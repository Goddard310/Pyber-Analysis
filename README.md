# Pyber-Analysis

&nbsp;See Pyber_Challenge.ipynb

## Overview of Project
Omar and I are assembling data on the three city types (Rural, Suburban and Urban) to encompass number of drivers and fares across those types.  Additionally, we are going to assess the fare data across the first 4 months of 2019.  

## City Type Analysis Results
- As expected, the number of rides increases with the density of the city (Urban being the most dense)
- The number of drivers also has a positive correlation with city 
- Fares have a negative correlation with city density.  Likely due to distance and number available drivers

## Fares Over Time
Across all city types, fares remained fairly consistent: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peaked in late February <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**BUT** the disparity between types remained very consistent <br>

## Summary
- We would advise Pyber to incentivize rural drivers more with the higher fares
- This would potentially bring drivers out of the Urban cities increasing those fares
- Omar and I agree that this would increase overall customer satisfaction while increasing revenues
